# its.analysis
BETA package for running time series analysis on small samples using the 'interruption treatment' approach

Included is some test data for analysis. This is a fake database from four made-up countries. Note, data can only be handled one-strata (country, region, etc) at a time, so it will be neccessary to subset this test data and any other cross-sectional data before running the functions.
