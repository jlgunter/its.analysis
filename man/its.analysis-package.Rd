\title{its.analysis: Running Interrupted Time Series Analysis}
\description{
Two functions for running and then post-estimating an Interrupted Time Series Analysis model, which is a wrapper for the aov function. This is a solution for running time series analyses on temporally short data.
}
\details{
Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) serves as a replacement for traditional time series modelling techniques when sample sizes are too small for autocorrelation to be effectively estimated and then reduced without overfitting model parameters.

The ITSA offered in this package is an AN(C)OVA model with a range of additional bolt-ons which provide further detailed information and test assumptions relative to time series analysis. See referenced paper for information on setting up data for ITSA.

It is incumbent on the researcher to sensibly define interruption time periods, and to use caution when fitting covariates to shorter data series. A limit of two covariates is enforced by the model as the ability to reliably fit a third covariate would indicate a data series long enough to run more conventional time series models with.
